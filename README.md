# Project-5
 Interactive Photo Gallery
 Implements the baguetteBox.js lightbox plugin and has search box functionality
## How I worked on this project
- My goal was to create a photo gallery with image enlargement using the baguetteBox plugin 
  and search functionality.  
- I built this app based on sample images.

## How to navigate this project
- Afterdownload, app can be accessed through the index.html file.
- Responsive CSS using Sass preprocessor: [https://github.com/seankozen/interactive-photo-gallery/tree/main/scss]
- JavaScript lightbox plugin baguetteBox.js: [https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js]

## Why I built the project this way
- Sass includes a lot of flexibility and options when styling pages.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but for this project the focus was on the front end.
  Connecting to an API was not yet covered, so all image files were hard coded into the app.

## If I had more time I would change this
- Connect it to an API or image database.
- Recreate it using React.js.
